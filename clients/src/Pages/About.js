      <p>
        Hi! I'm Nerya, a passionate software student and aspiring practical
        engineer specializing in modern web development.
        <br />
        This project is part of my learning journey, focused on mastering
        technologies such as React, Node.js, and full-stack programming.
        <br />
        <br />
        The customer management system you see here was built from scratch as a
        practical exercise in building responsive, user-friendly, and
        maintainable web applications.
        <br />
        You can add, edit, filter, and view customer data, switch between table
        and card views, and experience advanced state management with React
        Context.
        <br />
        <br />
